        <h1>Neutralize pH of water</h1>
        <p class="major">Grade 12 Chemistry Project -- Marawan, SalahDin, Younis
</p>
        <p>Water with a pH value less than 7 is acidic and tends to be corrosive. Acidic water (low pH) can leach metals from plumbing systems, which can cause pipes to leak. Metals that leach from the pipes (lead from lead pipes or copper from copper pipes) may also cause health problems.

        <h2>Definition and measurement units</h2>
        <p>pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base. pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water. Water that has more free hydrogen ions is acidic, whereas water that has more free hydroxyl ions is basic. Since pH can be affected by chemicals in the water, pH is an important indicator of water that is changing chemically. pH is reported in "logarithmic units". Each number represents a 10-fold change in the acidity/basicness of the water. Water with a pH of five is ten times more acidic than water having a pH of six.

        <h2>Importance of pH</h2>
        <p>The pH of water determines the solubility (amount that can be dissolved in the water) and biological availability (amount that can be utilized by aquatic life) of chemical constituents such as nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon) and heavy metals (lead, copper, cadmium, etc.). For example, in addition to affecting how much and what form of phosphorus is most abundant in the water, pH also determines whether aquatic life can use it. In the case of heavy metals, the degree to which they are soluble determines their toxicity. Metals tend to be more toxic at lower pH because they are more soluble. (Source: A Citizen's Guide to Understanding and Monitoring Lakes and Streams). As this diagram shows, pH ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs less than 7 are acidic while pHs greater than 7 are alkaline (basic). Normal rainfall has a pH of about 5.6â€”slightly acidic due to carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere. You can see that acid rain can be very acidic, and it can affect the environment in a negative way.

        <h2>pH and water quality</h2>
        <p>butExcessively high and low pHs can be detrimental for the use of water. High pH causes a bitter taste, water pipes and water-using appliances become encrusted with deposits, and it depresses the effectiveness of the disinfection of chlorine, thereby causing the need for additional chlorine when pH is high. Low-pH water will corrode or dissolve metals and other substances.

                    <p>To calculate the mass needed of sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
                    we should measure the pH of water to know the pH needed
                    from the base. The pH of the water is 5.64, so the
                    concentration is 10-5.64M calculated from pH = -log(concentration).
                    We want to neutralize the pH of the water (pH = 7), thus
                    the pH of the base equal 1.36 (from -log(10
                    <sup>-7</sup>/10 <sup>-5.64</sup>)), so the concertation in

                    <p>Although it may be known that pH is an important
                    property of water to decide its various conditions, some
                    may be oblivious to the method of base injection. Base
                    injection will, not only decrease the acidity of a
                    solution, but also results in a more suitable water in some
                    cases. Through a specific number of produces and a set of
                    materials it was reached that the base injection of a water
                    sample in hand resulted in a pH of 8.5. The consequence of
                    such a pH is neutral conductivity, which is certainly
                    helpful in some contexts.</p>
